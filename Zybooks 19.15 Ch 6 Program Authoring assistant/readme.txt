In this program, the user will enter a string of their choosing. Store the text in a string. Output the string. Implement a printMenu() method, which outputs a menu of user options for analyzing/editing the string, and returns the user's entered menu option. Each option is represented by a single character. Implement the getNumOfNonWSCharacters() method. getNumOfNonWSCharacters() has a string as a parameter and returns the number of characters in the string, excluding all whitespace. Call getNumOfNonWSCharacters() in the main() method. If an invalid character is entered, continue to prompt for a valid choice. Hint: Implement Quit before implementing other options. Call printMenu() in the main() method. Continue to call printMenu() until the user enters q to Quit. Implement the getNumOfWords() method. getNumOfWords() has a string as a parameter and returns the number of words in the string. Hint: Words end when a space is reached except for the last word in a sentence. Call getNumOfWords() in the main() method. Implement the findText() method, which has two strings as parameters. The first parameter is the text to be found in the user provided sample text, and the second parameter is the user provided sample text. The method returns the number of instances a word or phrase is found in the string. In the main() method, prompt the user for a word or phrase to be found and then call findText() in the main() method.  Implement the replaceExclamation() method. replaceExclamation() has a string parameter and returns a string which replaces each '!' character in the string with a '.' character. replaceExclamation() DOES NOT output the string. Call replaceExclamation() in the main() method, and then output the edited string. Implement the shortenSpace() method. shortenSpace() has a string parameter and returns a string that replaces all sequences of 2 or more spaces with a single space. shortenSpace() DOES NOT output the string. Call shortenSpace() in the main() method, and then output the edited string.
